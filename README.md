# Bamazon Storefront

## What Is This Thing?
An auction house app, using node.js and a local mySQL server to let users view and purchase items.

## How Do I Use It?
You'll need to install several packages first - inquirer and mySQL are both required for the app to function. You'll also need to provide your own local server password, either by editing the value of PASSWORD in the bamazoncustomer.js file directly, or by installing the dotenv package and assigning an appropriate key to a .env file.

Once all the requirements are present, simply running the file in node should automatically lead you through the process, displaying any local store data and allowing the user to buy whatever they'd like.

## Who Made It?
